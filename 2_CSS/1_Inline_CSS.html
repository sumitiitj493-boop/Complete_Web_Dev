<!--Inline CSS This is a way to apply styles directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. It's not recommended for larger projects as it can make the code hard to read and maintain. -->
<h1 style="color:red; font-size:40px">Hello World!</h1>
<p style="color:blue;background-color:yellow;">This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--Hard to maintain-imagine styling 100 paragraphs one by one-->
<!--No reusability:You have to repeat the code for each element-->
